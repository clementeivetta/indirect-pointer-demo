# Overview of the Indirect Pointer Demo Project

## Project Purpose
The **Indirect Pointer Demo** is a C project designed to illustrate the concept of indirect pointers in file operations. It specifically demonstrates how data is written to a file and when the indirect pointer is utilized during this process.

## Functionality
The project consists of a simple application that writes blocks of data to a file. It includes a mechanism to notify the user when the indirect pointer is about to be used, providing insight into how file systems manage data storage.

## Key Components
- **Source Code**: The main logic of the application is implemented in the `src` directory, with `main.c` serving as the entry point and `indirect.c` containing the core functionality.
- **Header Files**: The `include` directory contains header files that declare the functions used in the project, promoting modularity and reusability.
- **Testing**: The `tests` directory includes unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs` directory, including an overview and usage instructions.
- **Automation Scripts**: A shell script in the `scripts` directory simplifies the process of running the demo application.

## Usage
To use the project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `usage.md` file located in the `docs` directory. This will guide you through the setup and execution of the application.
